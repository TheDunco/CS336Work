Vision: 
    To make a simple, clean, and user friendly online D&D character sheet. 
My (Duncan's) initial vision for the project is to make the layout similar to the system I already
use, at Ember's RPG Vault (https://embersrpgvault.com/characters). I like how customizable and flexible
the system they have implemented is, but there are a few things I would want to tweak especially in terms
of user interface (ie. make it material design) and in the form of a system that does health math
for you (lets you say -10 health instea of clicking a button 10 times). A short/long rest button would also
be very nice to implement. I am concerned that the database schema for this could potentially become rather cumbersome,
as there is a lot of data to store per character, but I think it's managable. We may have to start by making it not 
persistent and adding the database functionality afterwards, but maybe it would be better to start it fully from the start *shrug*.
Either way, there is enough work to do to keep us occupied, but having a good reference to work from will help immensely, and a lot
of what we do will be fairly similar, so I imagine that will allow for re-use of CSS and other code via components.
