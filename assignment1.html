    <p>
      Animated gifs are one of my favorite things on the internet and I feel
      like they don't get used enough.

  <h3><em>Anyway...</em> here's a little more about me</h3>

  <p>
    If you want to know more about a person, I think one of the best things to
    do is look at what their favorite/most used websites are, so here are a few
    of mine
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://youtube.com">YouTube</a
      ><sub> <i> Of course, who doesn't use this these days</i></sub>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://reddit.com">Reddit</a
      ><sub><i> It's the front page of the internet!</i></sub>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://discord.gg">Discord</a
      ><sub> <i> Essential for social distancing and gamers alike</i></sub>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <br />
  <p>Here is a list of a few of my hobies and things I like to do...</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Playing Minecraft</li>
    <li>Playing D&D</li>
    <li>
      Listening to music <sub><i>(mostly EDM)</i></sub>
    </li>
    <li>Watching anime</li>
    <li>Watching Netflix and other shows</li>
    <li>Playing board and card games</li>
    <br />
  </ol>

  <div>
    <button
      onclick="window.location.href='https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp'"
    >
      I'm a button, but also a link
    </button>
    <p>Above is the <code>button</code></p>
    <p>
      The <code>button</code> of all <code>buttons</code> for a web developer
      who is assigned to do an assigment exclusively using HTML
    </p>
    <p>Behold it's glory, but do not be afraid to click it</p>
    <br />

    <form>
      <input
        type="button"
        onclick="window.location.href='https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/html/how-to-create-an-html-button-that-acts-like-a-link.html';"
        value="w3docs html-button"
      />
    </form>
    <p>
      I, of course, got the information on how to do this from the above button
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm not gonna say I came up with how to do that myself, but it's pretty
      cool
